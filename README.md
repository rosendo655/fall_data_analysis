# Project description
This project contains data extracted from a thermal sensor using an Arduino UNO, the sensor was capturing falls of several people 
at different angles, so there are also non-fall events

## Data description
In this folder are contained two subfolders whose contains fall data and non fall data, each on their respective folder, 
each file has an unique name which starts as "f_" for fall files and "nf_" for non-fall files, all of which are in a CSV 
format, the data files contains a set of rows each file has a different number of rows, and each row contains 17 columns,
the first one is the timestamp of the sensor read and the 16 columns left, contains each sector temperature according to 
the next diagram, it is measured in â„ƒ most of files contains an average of 8 frames per second but could be more or less.

### Sectors of the sensor
![alt text](images/diagram.png "sensor")

Each sector of the sensor has a position so in the files at each row contains a timestamp, and the temperature of all the sectors
at that time.

Example:

| timestamp                  | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   |

Each file contains an event of a person falling or a non-fall event, depending on the speed and type of the event there will be more 
or less rows (frames), if we assume that the average is 8 fps, each file contains at least 13 frames (1.X seconds), and up to 400 
frames (40 seconds)
