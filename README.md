# Project description
This project contains data extracted from a thermal sensor using an Arduino UNO, the sensor was capturing falls of several people 
at different angles, so there are also non-fall events

## Data description
In this folder are contained two subfolders whose contains fall data and non fall data, each on their respective folder, 
each file has an unique name which starts as "f_" for fall files and "nf_" for non-fall files, all of which are in a CSV 
format, the data files contains a set of rows each file has a different number of rows, and each row contains 17 columns,
the first one is the timestamp of the sensor read and the 16 columns left, contains each sector temperature according to 
the next diagram, it is measured in â„ƒ most of files contains an average of 8 frames per second but could be more or less.

### Sectors of the sensor
![alt text](images/diagram.png "sensor")

Each sector of the sensor has a position so in the files at each row contains a timestamp, and the temperature of all the sectors
at that time.

Example:

| timestamp                  | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   |

Each file contains an event of a person falling or a non-fall event, depending on the speed and type of the event there will be more 
or less rows (frames), if we assume that the average is 8 fps, each file contains at least 13 frames (1.X seconds), and up to 400 
frames (40 seconds)

## Fall scenes

| Scene Name            | Files         | Scene description                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Normal fall scene     | f_1 - f_101   | Falling from left or the right side of the sensor   |
| Frontal fall scene    | f_102 - f_122 | Falling towards to the sensor                       |
| Chair fall scene 1    | f_123 - f_148 | Falling from a chair                                |

## Fall Scene Tags
Each individual file has implicit tag of fall or not fall on it's name  but for the sake of convenience there's also a CSV file that contains the event of each file, and also contains the scene in which the file has happened, this will help us to differentiate the scenes where the algorithm works best, the file it's described as the next table.

| Filename  | Scene                 | Event    |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------|
| f_236.csv | diagonal fall scene 2 | fall     |
| f_237.csv | diagonal fall scene 2 | fall     |
| f_238.csv | diagonal fall scene 2 | fall     |
| nf_1.csv  | walking scene         | not fall |
| nf_2.csv  | walking scene         | not fall |
| ...       | ...                   | ...      |


## Notebooks
There are 3 notebooks in this projects, each one has it's main purpose, they're described as follows:


### Fall Data Analysis (file_viewer.ipynb)
This is the main notebook of the project, here you will find the implementation of the algorithm and test the algorithm on each file to see if the algorithm its capable of detect falls, this is an overall analysis, at the end we will get a confusion matrix describing the performance of the algorithm.

### File Viewer (file_viewer.ipynb)
This notebook serves as a file viewer where you can view an actual file in a more graphical way, instead of only numbers.

### Single File Analysis (single_file_analysis.ipynb)
The main purpose of this file is to view a detail of an individual file and show all the interactions between zones in
